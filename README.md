# DrivePass

Briefly summarize the DrivePass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
Within the two files represents the business and system design documents for the client DrivePass. The design documents describe that the client wants to create a system for providing better driving training to pass the DMV examines.

What did you particularly do well?
I feel like the part that I did the best at would be the UML class design of the DrivePass system. From my understanding of class objects I feel like this would be the route to take when designing the system. Each parent object feels like it has the appropriate methods for their children to inherit, and each child object has its own unique method that only pertains to that method.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
One part that I feel could use a revision would be the UML case diagram. It doesn't look very clean and clear as to what actors are to what cases and may also be missing an actor. I would also need to take a closer look as to what cases belong to what actors.

How did you interpret the user's needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user's needs when designing?
I interpretted the user's needs by going through the interview and associating what use case goes to what user making sure that everything is covered. The user's needs are important because there is a specific role this system is trying to cover. If it doesn't do its job correctly then it would be considered a failed product.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
When designing software it is important to consider what the client(s) want their product to do. Clear documentation to each use case is important so that creating the documentation will be useful for the scrum team so they can acknowledge and understand what needs to be done. The UML class diagram is also an important factor when creating the software so that it can be used to create the correct classes with their respective methods.
